This project is a personal website homework assignment for The Iron Yard Ruby on Rails bootcamp.

MAJOR POINTs of this ASSIGNMENT:
Homework assignments can be pushed to github.com as individual repositories, assigned a URL, and viewed
from personal webpage.

CSS "factories" (such as foundation-rails) contain sample stylesheets so developer doesn't have to re-invent
fairly standard CSS code already modeled elsewhere.

Assignment is incomplete.

TO DO:
Add CSS and styling from either Zurb Foundation or 10 original CSS stylings.
Use middleman-blog gem for Blog/Interests page.
