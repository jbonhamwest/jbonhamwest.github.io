<p>I came across this interesting blog post this week while I was in the middle
   of another code-learning marathon. Based on my background in adult education,
   the techniques described sound plausible. I think Iâ€™ll give it a try and report
   back to you later on my success implementing the Janki Method.</p>

  <p>Summer is truly here. While I'm in this intensive learning program I have been
    spending less time outside, so I was delighted to see my backyard was filled with
    fireflies when I went out with the dog tonight! Summer is my favorite time of year.</p>
