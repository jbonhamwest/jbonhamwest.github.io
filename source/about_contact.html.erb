<p>Hi! I'm Janice Bonham West. You've found my professional website where I share
projects I recently completed at the Ruby on Rails bootcamp of The Iron Yard
Academy in Durham, NC. When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family,
participating in water sports of all kinds, hiking, and listening to live music.
<p>
